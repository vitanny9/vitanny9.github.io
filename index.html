										<h3>2nd joke</h3>
										<p>A husband and wife are trying to set up a new password for their computer. The husband puts, "Mypenis," and the wife falls on the ground laughing because on the screen it says, "Error. Too short."</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<h3>3rd jokes</h3>
										<p>A child asked his father, "How were people born?" So his father said, "Adam and Eve made babi, then their babies became adults and made babies, and so on." The child then went to his mother, asked her the same question and she told him, "We were monkeys then we evolved to become like we are now." The child ran back to his father and said, "You lied to me!" His father replied, "No, your mom was talking about her side of the family."</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<h3>4th joke</h3>
										<p>Two students were arguing when their teacher entered the classroom. The teacher says, “Why are you arguing?” One boy answers, “We found a ten dollar bill and decided to give it to whoever tells the biggest lie.” "You should be ashamed of yourselves," said the teacher, "When I was your age I didn’t even know what a lie was." The boys gave the ten dollars to the teacher.</p>
